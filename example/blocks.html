<div id="main">
        <p> You can you define a base template, which has placeholders blocks
        The contents of these blocks can be filled
        dynamically by external files which contain html fragments, like this one.  </p>

        <p>
        This is the source for this fragment: <a href="example/blocks.html">example/blocks.html</a>
        </p>
</div>

<div id="right">
    <p> You can define as many place holder blocks as you like.  External files
    only need to fill the blocks which make sense for their page.  Notice that
    pages which don't define this right panel default back to the base index page.</p>
</div>
