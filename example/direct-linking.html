<div id="main">
        <p> Virtual addresses are maintained as links are navigated.  These
        virtual addresses can be linked to directly and allow the browser
        history and reload buttons to be utilized.  The linking structure is
        designed to be as SEO friendly as possible.  </p>

        <p>
        Hit your browser's refresh button to try out linking directly into the
        virtual address for this page.
        </p>

        <p>A handy trick is to put a small bit of script at the bottom of every
        external file which redirects to the page's virtual address.  That way
        if someone links directly to an external file they'll be redirected to
        see things rendered correctly.  Be sure to give the script tag for the
        redirect the class noplate-skip, so that noplate doesn't try and run
        the redirect when linking to it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        If you view the html for this fragment directly it'll
        redirect to this virtual address:
        <a href="example/direct-linking.html">example/direct-linking.html</a>
        </p>
</div>

<script class="noplate-skip">window.location.href='../#/example/direct-linking'</script>
