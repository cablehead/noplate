    Virtual addresses can also be linked to directly.
    Hit your browser's refresh button to try out linking directly into the
    virtual address for this page.

<div id="right">
    <p>A handy trick is to put a small bit of script at the bottom of every
    external file which redirects to the page's virtual address.  That way
    if someone links directly to an external file they'll be redirected to
    see things rendered correctly.  Be sure to give the script tag for the
    redirect the class <i>'noplate-skip'</i>, so that noplate doesn't try and run
    the redirect when linking to it.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you view the html for this fragment directly it'll
    redirect to this virtual address:
    <ul><li style="margin-left:40px;"><a href="example/direct-linking.html">example/direct-linking.html</a></li></ul>
    </p>
</div>

<script class="noplate-skip">window.location.href='../#/example/direct-linking'</script>
